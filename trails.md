# Hiking Trails

A list of interesting trails that we would like to hike.

## [Grön spår (Fontin)](https://www.alltrails.com/sv-se/led/sweden/vastra-gotaland/fontin-gron)

* Length: 10.1 km
* Difficulty: Moderate
* Estimated time: 2h49m
* Type: loop

Fontin is located in Kungälv, and the trailhead is quite close to Bohus Fästning, a fortress built in 1308. One idea is to combine the hike with a visit to the fortress. For example, we could take the bus to Bohus Fästning and then hike from there. From the fortress to the trailhead is about 2.4 km, or roughly a 35-minute walk. That would make this more of a full-day hike. --Younes

## [Kviberg - Bergsjön round loop](https://www.alltrails.com/sv-se/led/sweden/vastra-gotaland/kviberg-bergsjon-rundslinga)

* Length: 9.5 km
* Difficulty: Moderate
* Estimated time: 2h57m
* Type: loop

I haven’t done this hike yet. Kviberg is quite central in Gothenburg, which could make it a good option if we want something more casual. It is a moderate trail, but since it is in the greater Gothenburg area, there are several points where you could exit early if needed, which makes it quite suitable for a casual hike. --Younes

## [Rambergsmossen rundslinga](https://www.alltrails.com/sv-se/led/sweden/vastra-gotaland/rambergsmossen-runda)

* Length: 12.1 km
* Difficulty: Moderate
* Estimated time: 3h22m
* Type: loop

This hike seems fairly tough in some parts and quite long, but it looks like a rewarding trail. The terrain is varied and some sections require good stamina. I would suggest bringing a proper lunch and allowing plenty of time to rest in the middle. --Younes

## [Vrångö Loop](http://alltrails.com/trail/sweden/vastra-gotaland/vrango-runt?sh=awmbcb)

* Length: 7.6 km
* Difficulty: Easy
* Estimated time: 1hr27m
* Type: loop

When we do this and the Rörö trail, we might want to combine it with another activity (eg a picnic with a long time for swimming and socialization) so it isn't too short. Alternatively, we could also do another trail on a nearby island on the same hike. --Jerrad

## [Rörö Blå](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/vastra-gotaland/roro-bla?sh=awmbcb)

* Length: 5.6 km
* Difficulty: Hard
* Estimated time: 1hr8m
* Type: loop

There are some small mountains on Rörö that I like to climb when I go hiking here. They don't require actual climbing gear, just scrambling, but I think it's a good way to make up for the short trail length. It's also why I rated the difficulty as "hard" for this trail. --Jerrad

## [Klippans naturreservat](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/vastra-gotaland/hindas-milen?sh=awmbcb)

* Length: 9.3 km
* Difficulty: Moderate
* Estimated time: 2h34m
* Type: loop

I know a variation of this trail that combines it with another nearby trail to extend the length by about 2-3 km. --Jerrad

## [Vildmarksleden](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/vastra-gotaland/vildmarksleden-goteborg?sh=awmbcb)

* Length: 39.4 km
* Difficulty: Very Hard
* Estimated time: 11h6m
* Type: point to point

I can say from experience that this is a very difficult trail. It's hilly the entire way, quite technical in places, and because it's so long, you have to carry backpacking gear to overnight on it. So I would recommend either taking a slow pace and doing it in three days or doing a segment of it that we can complete within a single day instead of doing the entire thing. --Jerrad

## [Salomon Trail Tour](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/vastra-gotaland/salomon-trail-tour-skatas-21km?sh=awmbcb)

* Length: 21.4 km
* Difficulty: Hard
* Estimated time: 6h22m
* Type: loop

I haven't done this trail before, but it looks like a good option when we want an all-day challenge. --Jerrad

## [Göteborgs Skärgårdsled](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/vastra-gotaland/goteborgs-skargardsled?sh=awmbcb)

* Length: 21.9 km
* Difficulty: Moderate
* Estimated time: 4h15m
* Type: point to point

Another good option for an all-day hike, this trail runs from Fotö in the south to Hälsö in the north through Honö and Öckerö. I'm thinking about doing this one on Sept 13. --Jerrad
