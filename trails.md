# Hiking Trails

A list of interesting trails that we would like to hike.

## [Grön spår (Fontin)](https://www.alltrails.com/sv-se/led/sweden/vastra-gotaland/fontin-gron)

* Length: 10.1 km
* Difficulty: Moderate
* Estimated time: 2h49m
* Type: loop

## [Kviberg - Bergsjön round loop](https://www.alltrails.com/sv-se/led/sweden/vastra-gotaland/kviberg-bergsjon-rundslinga)

* Length: 9.5 km
* Difficulty: Moderate
* Estimated time: 2h57m
* Type: loop

## [Rambergsmossen rundslinga](https://www.alltrails.com/sv-se/led/sweden/vastra-gotaland/rambergsmossen-runda)

* Length: 12.1 km
* Difficulty: Moderate
* Estimated time: 3h22m
* Type: loop

## [Vrångö Loop](http://alltrails.com/trail/sweden/vastra-gotaland/vrango-runt?sh=awmbcb)

* Length: 7.6 km
* Difficulty: Easy
* Estimated time: 1hr27m
* Type: loop

When we do this and the Rörö trail, we might want to combine it with another activity (eg a picnic with a long time for swimming and socialization) so it isn't too short. Alternatively, we could also do another trail on a nearby island on the same hike. --Jerrad

## [Rörö Blå](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/vastra-gotaland/roro-bla?sh=awmbcb)

* Length: 5.6 km
* Difficulty: Hard
* Estimated time: 1hr8m
* Type: loop

There are some small mountains on Rörö that I like to climb when I go hiking here. They don't require actual climbing gear, just scrambling, but I think it's a good way to make up for the short trail length. It's also why I rated the difficulty as "hard" for this trail. --Jerrad

## [Klippans naturreservat](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/vastra-gotaland/hindas-milen?sh=awmbcb)

* Length: 9.3 km
* Difficulty: Moderate
* Estimated time: 2h34m
* Type: loop

I know a variation of this trail that combines it with another nearby trail to extend the length by about 2-3 km. --Jerrad

## [Vildmarksleden](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/vastra-gotaland/vildmarksleden-goteborg?sh=awmbcb)

* Length: 39.4 km
* Difficulty: Very Hard
* Estimated time: 11h6m
* Type: point to point

I can say from experience that this is a very difficult trail. It's hilly the entire way, quite technical in places, and because it's so long, you have to carry backpacking gear to overnight on it. So I would recommend either taking a slow pace and doing it in three days or doing a segment of it that we can complete within a single day instead of doing the entire thing. --Jerrad

## [Salomon Trail Tour](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/sweden/vastra-gotaland/salomon-trail-tour-skatas-21km?sh=awmbcb)

* Length: 21.4 km
* Difficulty: Hard
* Estimated time: 6h22m
* Type: loop

I haven't done this trail before, but it looks like a good option when we want an all-day challenge. --Jerrad
